## comet_neo.py

This script returns an observing plan for Comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE based on location for the hours centred around midnight. It is configured for my location in Scotland but the latitude, longitude, altitude and UTC offset can be updated for local conditions.

The script gets ephemeris data for the Comet and plots as altitude over the night along with the altitude of the sun and moon. In addition, the various twilights are shown based on the angle of the sun below the horizon.
